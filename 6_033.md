A `system` is a set of interconnected components that has an expected behaviour observed at the interface with its environment.

### Common Problems of Systems

* Emergent Properties: some things turn up only when the system is built.
* Propagation of Effects: there are no small changes in a large system.
* Incommensurate Scaling: different parts of the system exhibit different orders of growth.
* Trade-offs.
