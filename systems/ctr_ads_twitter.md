In this paper, we present the problem of click-through prediction for advertising in Twitter timeline:  given a user’s timeline, the session pushed to this user at a particular time, and a set of ads, we predict the probability that a particular ad will be clicked on if it is displayed at a particular position of this user’s timeline.
